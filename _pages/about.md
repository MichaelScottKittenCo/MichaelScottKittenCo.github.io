# THE SHORT & "TO THE POINT" VERSION:

***

## It was an unremarkable Sunday in April when a kitten ran through the Ryans' yard and up their driveway.

## She kept getting bigger

## And bigger

## And then smaller again (!!)

## And then it rained

## And then we brought her inside

## And they lived in our office and became the Michael Scott Kitten Company.

# THE LONG & COLORFUL VERSION:

## It was an unremarkable Sunday in April when a kitten ran through the Ryans' yard and up their driveway.

![hello new friend](/assets/photos/2019-04-20_21-53-54_951.jpg "Hello friend")

## Kendra followed this cat down the street and into the neighbors yard.

#### Two cans of food and 45 minutes later, Kendra (and her recruit, Colin) decided to give up and go back inside to watch Game of Thrones.

(Had they known what the season would amount to, their decision might be different and this story nonexistant.)

## This new cat didn't want to be captured by Kendra (can't imagine why), so Kendra did what Kendra does and yelled her address at the cat. 

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:55%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/26u49wAh0E8U3S4qA" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/reactionseditor-reaction-26u49wAh0E8U3S4qA">via GIPHY</a></p>

### Just in case, you know, the cat could (1) understand humans (2) speak english (3) fully grasp the addressing system in the united states.

## The next day, the cat appeared in their back yard again. 

#### And again, Kendra chased the cat. And again, Kendra did what Kendra does and employed one of the "cat trapping" strategies she read about on the internet and sprawled herself out on the ground next to the cat and exposed her belly. To Kendra, this was "attempting to calm the cat." To the neighbors, this looked like a half-naked tresspasser talking to a car. Thankfully, her recruit Colin was there to explain to any concerned onlookers. 

(Reinactment of the events. Racoon is Kendra.)

## The following day (Tuesday for those of you keeping track), Kendra was ready. 

#### "Let's have dinner in the back yard!" she said to her husband, Colin. "That sounds lovely," he said. "What prompted this great idea?" he inquired. "OH NOTHING," said Kendra, totally not defensively. 

(Obviously both of them knew the reason for holding "Dinner Vigil" was to see if this kitten would return.)

## Tuesday came and went and no kitten came into the yard.

####  Kendra was devistated. She had concocted this totally-not-creepy alternate reality where her two dead cats where in cat heaven guiding this distressed kitten to Kendra's house. In Kendra's mind, clearly there was a miscommunication (you know, between cat heaven and earth) and something needed to be done. 

(Reinactment of what Kendra was sure was happening in Cat Heaven)

## Dinner Vigil continued on Wednesday.

#### After sitting outside for some time with no kitten, Kendra and Colin decided to invite Pippin outside to accompany them in her "Adventure Tent"

## BUT THEN GUESS WHAT!! KITTEN CAME BACK!! 

![alt text](/assets/photos/wednesday.jpg "PK and Friend")

## AND BROUGHT A FRIEND!!

![alt text](/assets/photos/wednesday_friends.jpg "PK and Friend")

#### Pippin did not like this

![alt text](/assets/photos/pippin_nolike.jpg "PK and Friend")

## Kitten came back on Thursday, earned the name PK for "Pregnant Kitty" 

![alt text](/assets/photos/thursday.jpg "PK and Friend")

#### Clearly all of the collective creative energies of the Ryans were too busy building shelters for PK to actually come up with a name...

## PK kept coming back

![alt text](/assets/photos/pk_infence.jpg "PK and Friend")

(look behind Colin under the fence)

## PK would even hang out with us (but would not let us touch her)

![alt text](/assets/photos/pk_hanging.jpg "PK and Friend")

## She brought friends

![alt text](/assets/photos/friends.jpg "PK and Friend")

(These would become our "OCs" -- our Outside Cats, SockBoi and GreyBoi)

## Real talk: we had a great time waiting for her to show up every day

![alt text](/assets/photos/hanging.jpg "PK and Friend")






## This quickly became the routine.

## Eventually Kendra got curious where the fur friends went when they left her yard...

(From the perspective of the hole under the fence)

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:54%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/TDMbOHni02MZM8fTgS" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/mib-meninblack-mibinternational-TDMbOHni02MZM8fTgS">via GIPHY</a></p>

## So she got a ladder

![alt text](/assets/photos/ladder.jpg "PK and Friend")

## ... and "peeked"

![alt text](/assets/photos/curious.jpg "PK and Friend")

## Meanwile, PK kept getting bigger

![alt text](/assets/photos/2019-04-28_19-05-38_744.jpg "PK and Friend")

## And bigger

![alt text](/assets/photos/2019-05-02_08-14-45_904.jpg "PK and Friend")

## And Kendra kept building her "shelters" hoping she would decide to have her babies in the Ryans' yard. 

![alt text](/assets/photos/notinfort.jpg "PK and Friend")

(and getting discouraged when she would sit near but not in the shelters)

## At this point, PK was visiting multiple times a day

![alt text](/assets/photos/closefood.jpg "PK and Friend")

![alt text](/assets/photos/rainshelter.jpg "PK and Friend")


## And don't for a second think Kendra was the only obsessed one... 

### Colin got a nestcam for outside so we could safely monitor PK & crew


![alt text](/assets/photos/outside_nestcam2.jpg "PK and Friend")

## BTS: View from the ladder

## Quick reminder -- she was SO BIG.

![alt text](/assets/photos/so_big2.jpg "PK and Friend")

## And then one day... PK didn't come for any food or any feedings. 

### This was Kendra

### This was Colin trying to help Kendra

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/GVSFDBNpirGyQ" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/GVSFDBNpirGyQ">via GIPHY</a></p>

### This was Kendra for the whole next day

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:55%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/r28Sg4Twrwtxu" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/anxious-pll-finale-summer-r28Sg4Twrwtxu">via GIPHY</a></p>


## AND THEN SHE CAME BACK!! She was much smaller and had a bloody tail...

![alt text](/assets/photos/now_smaller2.jpg "PK and Friend")

## Kendra was SURE this meant The Worst and continued to freak out and build shelters that were less shelter and more shrines-to-her-insanity

![alt text](/assets/photos/another_shelter2.jpg "PK and Friend")

## Meanwile, Colin:

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:50%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Xm62Xd4mlzovC" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/date-excitement-myself-Xm62Xd4mlzovC">via GIPHY</a></p>

## UNTIL he had the brilliant idea to "repair the fence" 

![alt text](/assets/photos/health_check2.jpg "PK and Friend")

## And while doing "routine maintence" on the fence and our sprinkler system, Colin captured the first confirmation that yes, there were kittens.

<!-- ![alt text](/assets/photos/colin_check.jpg "PK and Friend") -->

## With kittens now confirmed, Kendra's crazy didn't diminish, it was simply redirected. 

![alt text](/assets/photos/kendracrazy_red2.jpg "PK and Friend")

![alt text](/assets/photos/kendracrazy2.jpg "PK and Friend")





## And then smaller again (!!)



## And then it rained

![alt text](/assets/photos/2019-05-16_08-26-43_036.jpg "PK and Friend")

## And then we brought her inside

![alt text](/assets/photos/2019-05-16_10-54-36_868.jpg "PK and Friend")

## And they lived in our office and became the Michael Scott Kitten Company.
