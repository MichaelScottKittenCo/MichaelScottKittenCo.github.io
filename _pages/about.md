# It was an unremarkable Sunday in April when a kitten ran through the Ryan's yard and up their driveway.

# Kendra followed this cat down the street and into the neighbors yard. 


### Two cans of food and 45 minutes later, Kendra (and her recruit, Colin) decided to give up and go back inside to watch Game of Thrones.

(Had they known what the season would amount to, their decision might be different and this story nonexistant.)

# As this new cat didn't want to be captured by Kendra (can't imagine why not), Kendra did what Kendra does and yelled her address at the cat. 

## Just in case, you know, the cat could (1) understand humans (2) speak english (3) fully grasp the addressing system in the united states.

# The next day, the cat appeared in their back yard again. 

### And again, Kendra chased the cat. And again, Kendra did what Kendra does and employed one of the "cat trapping" strategies she read about on the internet and sprawled herself out on the ground next to the cat and exposed her belly. To Kendra, this was "attempting to calm the cat." To the neighbors, this looked like a half-naked tresspasser talking to a car. Thankfully, her recruit Colin was there to explain to any concerned onlookers. 

# The following day (Tuesday for those of you keeping track), Kendra was ready. "Let's have dinner in the back yard!" she said to her husband. "That sounds lovely," he said. "What prompted this great idea?" he inquired. "OH NOTHING" she said, totally not defensively. 

### Obviously both of them knew the reason for holding "Dinner Vigil" was to see if this kitten would return.

# Tuesday came and went and no kitten came into the yard. Kendra was devistated. She had concocted this totally-not-creepy alternate reality where her two dead cats where in cat heaven guiding this distressed kitten to Kendra's house. In Kendra's mind, clearly there was a miscommunication and something went wrong and there needed to be something done about it. 

# She kept getting bigger

# And then we brought her inside
